# Lex Program for Comment Handling and Character Case Conversion

This Lex program is designed to:
1. Recognize and print both block comments (`/* comment */`) and single-line comments (`// comment`).
2. Convert uppercase letters to lowercase, and lowercase letters to uppercase.
3. Handle newline characters and any other characters not covered by the previous rules.

Below is an in-depth explanation of how the program works, including the pattern matching process and the role of each part of the code.

## Lex Program Structure

As with most Lex programs, this one follows the standard three-section format:

1. **Declarations Section**: Includes any necessary headers and global declarations.
2. **Rules Section**: Contains regular expressions (patterns) and their corresponding actions.
3. **User Code Section**: Contains the `main()` function and additional functions required for lexical analysis.

## Lex Program Code

Here is the complete Lex code:

```lex
%{
#include <stdio.h>  // Include the standard I/O library
%}

%%
// Define patterns and actions

"/*"([^*]|\*+[^*/])*\*+    { printf("%s", yytext); }  // Block comments (/* */)
"//".*                     { printf("%s", yytext); }  // Single-line comments (//)
[A-Z]                      { printf("%c", yytext[0] + 'a' - 'A'); }  // Convert uppercase to lowercase
[a-z]                      { printf("%c", yytext[0] + 'A' - 'a'); }  // Convert lowercase to uppercase
\n                         { printf("\n"); }  // Handle newlines
.                           { printf("%s", yytext); }  // Handle all other characters

%%

// Function called when the end of input is reached
int yywrap(){
    return 1;
}

// Main function to start lexical analysis
int main(void) {
    yylex();  // Start lexical analysis
    return 0;  // Exit successfully
}
```

### Section 1: Declarations Section

```lex
%{
#include <stdio.h>  // Include standard I/O functions (e.g., printf)
%}
```

- **Purpose**: The **Declarations Section**, enclosed between `%{` and `%}`, includes the `stdio.h` header so the program can use functions like `printf()` to print output. 
- **No global variables** are declared in this section.

### Section 2: Rules Section

The **Rules Section** defines the patterns and the corresponding actions to take when a match is found in the input.

```lex
"/*"([^*]|\*+[^*/])*\*+    { printf("%s", yytext); }  // Match block comments
"//".*                     { printf("%s", yytext); }  // Match single-line comments
[A-Z]                      { printf("%c", yytext[0] + 'a' - 'A'); }  // Convert uppercase to lowercase
[a-z]                      { printf("%c", yytext[0] + 'A' - 'a'); }  // Convert lowercase to uppercase
\n                         { printf("\n"); }  // Handle newlines
.                           { printf("%s", yytext); }  // Handle all other characters
```

#### Breakdown of the Rules:

1. **Pattern: `"/*"([^*]|\*+[^*/])*\*+`**
   - **Explanation**: This pattern matches **block comments** of the form `/* comment */`.
     - `"/*"`: Matches the start of a block comment.
     - `([^*]|\*+[^*/])*`: Matches the contents of the block comment.
       - `[^*]`: Matches any character that is not an asterisk.
       - `\*+[^*/]`: Matches one or more asterisks followed by any character that is not a slash (`/`).
     - `\*+`: Matches one or more asterisks, ensuring that the comment ends with a closing `*/`.
   - **Action**: When a block comment is matched, the program prints it using `printf("%s", yytext);`. Here, `yytext` contains the matched text.
   
   **Example**: If the input is `/* This is a block comment */`, the output will be:
   ```
   /* This is a block comment */
   ```

2. **Pattern: `"//".*`**
   - **Explanation**: This pattern matches **single-line comments** starting with `//` and continuing until the end of the line.
     - `"//"`: Matches the start of a single-line comment.
     - `.*`: Matches any sequence of characters until the end of the line (the newline is not included in the match).
   - **Action**: When a single-line comment is matched, it is printed using `printf("%s", yytext);`.
   
   **Example**: If the input is `// This is a single-line comment`, the output will be:
   ```
   // This is a single-line comment
   ```

3. **Pattern: `[A-Z]`**
   - **Explanation**: This pattern matches any **uppercase letter** (A-Z).
   - **Action**: When an uppercase letter is matched, it is converted to the corresponding lowercase letter by using:
     - `yytext[0] + 'a' - 'A'`: This expression calculates the ASCII value of the lowercase version of the matched letter.
     - The result is printed with `printf("%c", ...)`.
   
   **Example**: If the input is `HELLO`, the output will be:
   ```
   hello
   ```

4. **Pattern: `[a-z]`**
   - **Explanation**: This pattern matches any **lowercase letter** (a-z).
   - **Action**: When a lowercase letter is matched, it is converted to the corresponding uppercase letter by using:
     - `yytext[0] + 'A' - 'a'`: This expression calculates the ASCII value of the uppercase version of the matched letter.
     - The result is printed with `printf("%c", ...)`.
   
   **Example**: If the input is `hello`, the output will be:
   ```
   HELLO
   ```

5. **Pattern: `\n`**
   - **Explanation**: This pattern matches **newline characters** (`\n`).
   - **Action**: When a newline is encountered, it is printed as-is using `printf("\n");`.
   
   **Example**: If the input contains a newline (e.g., after a comment or a sequence of letters), the newline is preserved in the output.

6. **Pattern: `.`**
   - **Explanation**: The dot (`.`) is a special regular expression symbol that matches **any single character**. This pattern matches any character that is not covered by the previous rules.
   - **Action**: Any unmatched character is printed as-is using `printf("%s", yytext);`.
   
   **Example**: If the input is `123`, the output will be:
   ```
   123
   ```

### Section 3: User Code Section

```c
int yywrap() {
    return 1;
}

int main(void) {
    yylex();  // Start lexical analysis
    return 0;  // Exit successfully
}
```

#### `yywrap()` Function:
- **Purpose**: This function is called when `yylex()` reaches the end of the input. It returns `1` to indicate that there is no more input to process, allowing `yylex()` to terminate.
- **Usage**: Lex requires `yywrap()` to be defined for proper handling of input termination.

#### `main()` Function:
- **Purpose**: This is the main entry point of the program. It starts the lexical analysis by calling `yylex()`.
- **`yylex()`**: This function, generated by Lex, processes the input and applies the rules defined in the **Rules Section**. When `yylex()` finds a match, it executes the corresponding action.
- **Return**: The program exits with a return value of `0`, indicating successful execution.

## How the Program Works

### Input Processing

1. The program reads input from `stdin` (standard input) or any file provided to `yyin`.
2. Based on the patterns defined in the **Rules Section**, it processes:
   - **Block comments**: Recognizes and prints block comments of the form `/* comment */`.
   - **Single-line comments**: Recognizes and prints single-line comments of the form `// comment`.
   - **Uppercase letters**: Converts them to lowercase and prints the result.
   - **Lowercase letters**: Converts them to uppercase and prints the result.
   - **Newline characters**: Prints them as-is.
   - **Other characters**: Prints them as-is if they don't match any of the above patterns.

### Sample Input and Output

**Input**:
```c
/* This is a block comment */
HELLO
// This is a single-line comment
hello123
```

**Output**:
```c
/* This is a block comment */
hello
// This is a single-line comment
HELLO123
```

### Explanation:
1. The block comment `/* This is a block comment */` is matched and printed as-is.
2. The uppercase string `HELLO` is converted to `hello`.
3. The single-line comment `// This is a single-line comment` is matched and printed as-is.
4. The lowercase string `hello` is converted to `HELLO`, and the digits `123` are printed as-is since they donâ€™t match any conversion

 rules.

## Compiling and Running the Program

1. **Save the Lex code** in a file, for example, `comment_case_converter.l`.

2. **Compile the Lex code** using the following commands:

```bash
lex comment_case_converter.l   # This generates lex.yy.c
gcc lex.yy.c -o comment_case_converter -ll  # Compiles and links the Lex library
```

3. **Run the program**:

```bash
./comment_case_converter
```

Provide input, either by typing it or redirecting input from a file, and observe the output based on the patterns and actions defined in the Lex program.

## Summary

This Lex program performs multiple tasks:
1. **Comment Handling**:
   - Matches and prints both block (`/* comment */`) and single-line comments (`// comment`).
2. **Character Case Conversion**:
   - Converts uppercase letters to lowercase and vice versa.
3. **Newline and Other Characters**:
   - Handles newline characters and prints other unmatched characters as-is.

It demonstrates how Lex can be used to recognize patterns like comments and perform text transformation tasks like character case conversion. The program processes input text according to the defined rules and produces the transformed output accordingly.
